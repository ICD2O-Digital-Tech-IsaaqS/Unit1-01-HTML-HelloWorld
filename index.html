    <h1>Favourite Passtime</h1>
    <p>I have like three favourite passtime to do. First one is just going to the army cadets on Monday and I just reached silver star this week so that would be fun. The second thing I like to do is going out with my dogs to go play with them in the dog park or just walking with them outside. The last thing I like to do is playing videogames I recently decided to get marvel rivals I have been on this game non-stop and I just gold rank the other day. </p>
    <h2>	least favourite subject	</h2>
    <p>My least favourite subject is history because really don't care about the past and I would like to learn history on my own time other than getting force to learn it.</p>
